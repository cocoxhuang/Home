							<p> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool, demonstrating promise across various applications, including recommendation
								systems, fraud detection, and community detection in social networks. However, in certain areas, such as the domain of financial market studies, 
								though GNNs have attracted substantial attention and research, there is a challenge of insufficient appropriate graphs that presents an obstacle to the effective application of GNNs.</p>
							<p>Graphs, at their core, are comprised of nodes and edges that link these nodes together. Within the financial market context, nodes are often entities such as firms or stocks, and edges represent relationships between these entities. GNNs as a class of deep learning models seek to refine node representations by processing and aggregating information from neighboring nodes within the graph, which allows them to excel in real-world applications where understanding relationships between entities is crucial. </p>
							<p>We introduce a novel approach that combines graph discovery techniques with GNN models to enhance the identification of interconnections within financial markets. This method aims to address the issue of inadequate suitable graphs by leveraging data to uncover the latent graph, thereby tailoring node embeddings to specific tasks. Furthermore, employing graph discovery models eliminates the requirement for expertise in a field to generate graphs, saving both time and effort that would otherwise be spent on manual graph creation.</p>
